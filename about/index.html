	<p>Hello! My name is Jeffery L. Guo. I'm from Eden Prairie, MN and am currently a senior studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, expected to graduate May 2024.</p>
    <p>I'll be pursuing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University in Dr. Jong Hyun Choi's lab, starting Fall 2024. I'll be working with DNA nanomachines/nanorobots for biomedical/biological applications.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing piano, violin, and guitar, producing <a href="https://linktr.ee/jlgmusic">music</a>, working out at the gym, and playing and watching soccer.</p>
