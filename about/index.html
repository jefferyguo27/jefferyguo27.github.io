	<p>Hello! My name is Jeffery L. Guo. I'm a Mechanical Engineering Ph.D student in the Choi Lab at Purdue University. I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in May 2024
        with a B.S in Mechanical Engineering, graduating with the designation, "Graduated with Highest Disinction."
    </p>
    <p>Broadly, my research pertains to the field of <strong>DNA nanotechnology</strong> where DNA is taken out of its biological context as a 
        carrier of genetic information and instead used as an engineering material. By utilizing fundamental principles of complementary Watson-Crick base pairing,
        DNA can be used to program and create complex static and dynamic nanostructures and integrate with other non-DNA systems. More specifically, my research is related to
        DNA walkers, synthetic analogs of motor proteins such as kinesin and dynein. DNA walkers have promising biomedical potential as platforms for drug delivery and biosensing.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing piano, violin, and guitar, producing <a href="https://linktr.ee/jlgmusic">music</a>, working out at the gym, and playing and watching soccer.</p>
